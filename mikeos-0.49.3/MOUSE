I think this mode dont need to use the 0EBh(Read Data)-command.
Just use 0F4h (Enable Data Reporting), then the mouse sends data
to the controller.




Yes, this routine check the mouse activity.
I use this for propper keyboard input.

in al, 64h ; status
test al, 1 ; something in the buffer?
jz NOKEY
test al, 20h ; PS2-Mouse
jnz MOUSE
in al, 60h ; get key from keyboard
dec al ; escape?
jz TERMINATE
.... ; check which key is pressed
....
MOUSE:
.... ; check mouse activity
....
NOKEY: ; nothing happends
....
....
TERMINATE: ; programm end
