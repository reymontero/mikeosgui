0.49 (XX April 2007)
------------------------

# New system call: os_string_truncate -- cuts string down to specified
  number of characters from start

# New system call: os_bcd_to_int -- converts binary coded decimal
  numbers into integers

# New system call: os_get_time_string -- generates a string with
  the current time (eg '20:41')

# os_string_chomp now strips leading spaces as well as trailing

# os_print_blank_line renamed to os_print_newline

# os_int_to_string updated -- now based on a public domain routine
  that handles full 16-bit registers

# CLI now strips spaces with os_string_chomp before checking for blank
  lines -- stops it complaining that ' ' (space) is not a valid program

# os_string_strip and show_files now use os_buffer as a temporary store,
  rather than their own strings (reduces kernel size by 512 bytes)

# os_int_reboot internal call added, which reboots the machine
  via the keyboard controller

# BUGS.TXT added as a reminder of known problems



0.40 (16th January 2007)
------------------------

CHANGES BY PETER NEMETH:

# os_syscalls.asm renamed to syscalls.asm, to support the DOS 8.3
  filename character format (NASM could not find certain files)

# BUILD.BAT added for DOS users

# Divide by zero handling (int 0h) added

# Drive descriptor fixed in bootsector and some features added;
  now it will not hang the system if there is a boot failure

# Before loading a DOS program, save and clean up registers

# DOS exit call fixed: does not restart the OS, and programs
  can exit with error codes

# DOS 'get date' interrupt added; now returns the current date

# Some rets replaced with irets

# DOS Ctrl+Break handler added; not yet working (IRQ 9 doesn't
  call int 0x1B)

# DOS print character via printer added

# Some helper routines added for DOS

# DOS CP/M compatible routines added

# DOS reset disk added

# DOS set current drive added

# DOS get current drive added

# DOS set date function added

# DOS get time function added

# DOS set time function added

# DOS functions sorted by function number

# DOS unimplemented interrupt call fixed; now only exits from
  program and display message, not restart OS

# DOS serial port and modem support interrupt added;
  read and write from STDAUX (COM1)

# DOS interrupt flush buffer and read fixed; now really flush the
  buffer before read


CHANGES BY MIKE SAUNDERS:

# gfxdemo.asm fixed to quit properly

# DOS set vector routine added

# Added mini Program Segment Prefix block to os_app_data in
  os_main.asm -- needs to be done properly, but VisiCalc
  now starts up



0.30 (12th November 2006)
-------------------------

# New command line interface mode, currently featuring DIR, HELP,
  CLS, PROMPT, VER and EXIT inbuilt commands. Also trims input
  (eg you can enter 'hello' to run HELLO.BIN on the disk)

# os_alert_dialog renamed os_dialog_box due to new feature: multiple
  button support. If DX = 1 when called, it presents two buttons
  (OK and Cancel) with the selection returned in AX

# New system call: os_string_compare -- takes two strings and sets
  the carry flag if they're the same

# New system call: os_string_chomp -- removes trailing spaces
  at the end of a string

# New system call: os_string_strip -- removes character specified
  in AX from the string in SI

# Kernel source split into multiple files for easier editing, based
  around os_main.asm which includes the rest. These kernel files
  are now in kernel/, with the bootloader in bootloader/

# os_program_load now sets carry flag if program not found, instead
  of bailing out to os_fatal_error, and also returns from a call

# os_program_load can clear the screen before loading a program if
  BX = 1. Useful for the file selector dialog

# Changed os_pause to use BIOS call (needs testing)

# Fixed zero-termination bug in os_string_copy

# MikeOS programs that include mikedev.inc can now access the
  8K scratchpad buffer via os_buffer

# Moved DOSTEST.ASM, for testing DOS compatibility, into the
  programs/ directory (so that it's automatically built)

# Bootloader now has error messages, rather than just freezing

# Split up the assemble and disk-image scripts to avoid loopback
  mounting errors, and simplify editing

# Various small cleanups and fixes



0.25 (27th October 2006)
------------------------

# New system call: os_modify_int_handler

# Removed DOS compatibility interrupt handlers from bootloader,
  replaced with code in kernel using os_modify_int_handler

# System call for os_get_file_list routine added

# Music keyboard demo app no longer uses 100% CPU



0.24 (25th October 2006)
------------------------

# First SourceForge release
